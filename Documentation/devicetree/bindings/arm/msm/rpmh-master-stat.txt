* RPMH Master Stats

Differet Subsystems maintains master data in SMEM.
It tells about the individual masters information at any given
time like "system sleep counts", "system sleep last entered at"
and "system sleep accumulated duration" etc. These stats can be
show to the user using the debugfs interface of the kernel.
To achieve this, device tree node has been added.

The required properties for rpmh-master-stats are:

- compatible: "qcom,rpmh-master-stats".

Example:

qcom,rpmh-master-stats {
	compatible = "qcom,rpmh-master-stats";
};
