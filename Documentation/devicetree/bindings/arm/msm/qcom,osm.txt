Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. OSM Bindings

Operating State Manager (OSM) is a hardware engine used by some Qualcomm
Technologies, Inc. (QTI) SoCs to manage frequency and voltage scaling
in hardware. OSM is capable of controlling frequency and voltage requests
for multiple clusters via the existence of multiple OSM domains.

Properties:
- compatible
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be "qcom,clk-cpu-osm" or "qcom,clk-cpu-osm-v2".

- reg
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Addresses and sizes for the memory of the OSM controller.

- reg-names
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Address names. Must be "osm_l3_base", "osm_pwrcl_base",
		    "osm_perfcl_base".
		    Must be specified in the same order as the corresponding
		    addresses are specified in the reg property.

- l3-devs
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: List of phandles to devices that the OPP tables with the L3
		    frequency and voltage mappings are loaded for.

- clock-names
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Must be "aux_clk".

- clocks
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: Phandle to the aux clock device.

Example:
	clock_cpucc: qcom,cpucc@0x17d41000 {
		compatible = "qcom,clk-cpu-osm";
		reg = <0x17d41000 0x1400>,
			<0x17d43000 0x1400>,
			<0x17d45800 0x1400>;
		reg-names = "osm_l3_base", "osm_pwrcl_base", "osm_perfcl_base";

		l3-devs = <&phandle0 &phandle1 &phandle2>;

		clock-names = "xo_ao";
		clocks = <&clock_rpmh RPMH_CXO_CLK_A>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
