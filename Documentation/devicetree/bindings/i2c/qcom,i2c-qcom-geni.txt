Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be:
   * "qcom,i2c-geni.
 - reg: Should contain QUP register address and length.
 - interrupts: Should contain I2C interrupt.
 - #address-cells: Should be <1> Address cells for i2c device address
 - #size-cells: Should be <0> as i2c addresses have no size component

Child nodes should conform to i2c bus binding.

Example:

i2c@a94000 {
	compatible = "qcom,i2c-geni";
	reg = <0xa94000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 358 0>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
};
