BCL Peripheral driver for PMIC5:
===============================================================================
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc's PMIC has battery current limiting peripheral,
which can monitor for high battery current and low battery voltage in the
hardware. The BCL peripheral driver interacts with the PMIC peripheral using
the SPMI driver interface. The hardware can take threshold for notifying for
high battery current or low battery voltage events. This driver works only
with PMIC version 5, where the same BCL peripheral can be found in multiple
PMIC's that are used in a device, with limited functionalities. For example,
one PMIC can have only vbat monitoring, while the other PMIC can have both
vbat and ibat monitoring. This is a common driver, that can interact
with the multiple BCL peripherals.

Required Parameters:
- compatible: must be
	'qcom,msm-bcl-pmic5' for bcl peripheral in PMIC version 5.
- reg: <a b> where 'a' is the starting register address of the PMIC
	peripheral and 'b' is the size of the peripheral address space.
- interrupts: <a b c> Where 'a' is the SLAVE ID of the PMIC, 'b' is
		the peripheral ID and 'c' is the interrupt number in PMIC.
- interrupt-names: user defined names for the interrupts. These
		interrupt names will be used by the drivers to identify the
		interrupts, instead of specifying the ID's. bcl driver will
		accept these standard interrupts.
		"bcl-low-vbat"
		"bcl-high-ibat"

Example:
		bcl@4200 {
			compatible = "qcom,msm-bcl-pmic5";
			reg = <0x4200 0xFF>;
			interrupts = <0x2 0x42 0x0>,
					<0x2 0x42 0x1>;
			interrupt-names = "bcl-high-ibat",
						"bcl-low-vbat";
		};
