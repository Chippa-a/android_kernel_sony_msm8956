BCL PMIC Peripheral driver for legacy PMIC peripherals:
===============================================================================
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc's PMIC has battery current limiting peripheral, which can monitor for
high battery current and low battery voltage in the hardware. The BCL
peripheral driver interacts with the PMIC peripheral using the SPMI driver
interface. The hardware can take threshold for notifying for high battery
current or low battery voltage events.

Required Parameters:
- compatible: must be
	'qcom,msm-bcl' for bcl peripheral without LMH DCVSh
- reg: <a b> where 'a' is the starting register address of the PMIC
	peripheral and 'b' is the size of the peripheral address space.
	If the BCL inhibit current derating feature is enabled, this must also
	have the PON spare registers as well. Example: <a b c d> where
	c is the first PON spare register that will be written and d is the
	size of the registers space needed to be written.
- reg-names: a list of names of the registers corresponding to the reg
	property. The fuel gauge peripheral should be "fg_user_adc", the
	PON spare should be "pon_spare".
- interrupts: <a b c> Where 'a' is the SLAVE ID of the PMIC, 'b' is
		the peripheral ID and 'c' is the interrupt number in PMIC.
- interrupt-names: user defined names for the interrupts. These
		interrupt names will be used by the drivers to identify the
		interrupts, instead of specifying the ID's. bcl driver will
		accept these two standard interrupts.
		"bcl-low-vbat"
		"bcl-high-ibat"

- qcom,vbat-scaling-factor: The scaling factor to be used for converting
		the raw vbat ADC value to milli-volt.
- qcom,vbat-gain-numerator: The numerator of the vbat gain correction factor.
- qcom,vbat-gain-denominator: The denominator of the vbat gain correction
		factor.
- qcom,ibat-scaling-factor: The scaling factor to be used for converting
		the raw ibat ADC value to micro-amps.
- qcom,ibat-gain-numerator: The numerator of the ibat gain correction factor.
- qcom,ibat-gain-denominator: The denominator of the ibat gain correction
		factor.
- qcom,ibat-offset-numerator: The numerator of the ibat offset correction
		factor.
- qcom,ibat-offset-denominator: The denominator of the ibat offset
		correction factor.


Optional Parameters:
- qcom,inhibit-derating-ua: The amount that the bcl current high trip threshold
		should be lowered by when the bcl peripheral is operating in a
		dead time.
