config IPA
	tristate "IPA support"
	depends on SPS && NET
	help
	  This driver supports the Internet Packet Accelerator (IPA) core.
	  IPA is a programmable protocol processor HW block.
	  It is designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets
	  for various use cases independent of radio technology.
	  The driver support client connection and configuration
	  for the IPA core.
	  Kernel and user-space processes can call the IPA driver
	  to configure IPA core.

config RMNET_IPA
	tristate "IPA RMNET WWAN Network Device"
	depends on IPA && MSM_QMI_INTERFACE
	help
	  This WWAN Network Driver implements network stack class device.
	  It supports Embedded data transfer from A7 to Q6. Configures IPA HW
	  for RmNet Data Driver and also exchange of QMI messages between
	  A7 and Q6 IPA-driver.

config GSI
	bool "GSI support"
	help
	  This driver provides the transport needed to talk to the
	  IPA core. It replaces the BAM transport used previously.

	  The GSI connects to a peripheral component via uniform TLV
	  interface, and allows it to interface with other peripherals
	  and CPUs over various types of interfaces such as MHI, xDCI,
	  xHCI, GPI, WDI, Ethernet, etc.

config IPA3
	tristate "IPA3 support"
	depends on GSI && NET
	help
	  This driver supports the Internet Packet Accelerator (IPA3) core.
	  IPA is a programmable protocol processor HW block.
	  It is designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets
	  for various use cases independent of radio technology.
	  The driver support client connection and configuration
	  for the IPA core.
	  Kernel and user-space processes can call the IPA driver
	  to configure IPA core.

config RMNET_IPA3
	tristate "IPA3 RMNET WWAN Network Device"
	depends on IPA3 && MSM_QMI_INTERFACE
	help
	  This WWAN Network Driver implements network stack class device.
	  It supports Embedded data transfer from A7 to Q6. Configures IPA HW
	  for RmNet Data Driver and also exchange of QMI messages between
	  A7 and Q6 IPA-driver.

config IPA_UT
	tristate "IPA Unit-Test Framework and Test Suites"
	depends on IPA3 && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This Module implements IPA in-kernel test framework.
	  The framework supports defining and running tests, grouped
	  into suites according to the sub-unit of the IPA being tested.
	  The user interface to run and control the tests is debugfs file
	  system.

config SPS
	bool "SPS support"
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  The SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) is a DMA engine.
	  It can move data in the following modes:
		1. Peripheral-to-Peripheral.
		2. Peripheral-to-Memory.
		3. Memory-to-Memory.

config SPS_SUPPORT_BAMDMA
	bool "SPS support BAM DMA"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  The BAM-DMA is used for Memory-to-Memory transfers.
	  The main use cases is RPC between processors.
	  The BAM-DMA hardware has 2 registers sets:
		1. A BAM HW like all the peripherals.
		2. A DMA channel configuration (i.e. channel priority).

config SPS_SUPPORT_NDP_BAM
	bool "SPS support NDP BAM"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  No-Data-Path BAM is used to improve BAM performance.
